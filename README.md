# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

Minimal reproduction of https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/35012

Based on the default template so there is quite a lot of noise but see
`app/_layout.tsx`, `app/(tabs)/HomeScreen.tsx` and `app/(tabs)/index.tsx` for
the relevant parts of the bug

Its not super clear in the video, but the video seems to still be playing but
the screen is black. The controls are still responsive.
